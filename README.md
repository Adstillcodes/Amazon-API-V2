Hi ppl, this is my firts API, pls tell me if there is any improvement that can be made or any bugs you find. 

What you need:

You Need a scraperAPI key you can get it from: https://scraperapi.com and these are a few example queries:
localhost:5000/search/"enter search query from amazon like mackbook air"?api_key="your api key"

localhost:5000/products/"Enter product ID like B07X6C9RMF"?api_key="your api key" you can find the product ID on an amazon product after /dp in the url  

Note: No need to add double quotes or anything written for explanation in the queries add the api key you got from scraperapi instead of your api key again no need of double quotes.

THnkyou for visiting, dont forget to give a star ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
